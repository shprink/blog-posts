#### By type

#### By Feature

### Naming Conventions

AngularJs introduced some time ago the dependency injection pattern. It is good for testability and maintanability but a downside of it is that there is no namespacing. It means that naming collision is to be expected if you do not follow a certain logic on naming things. Angular uses $ or $$ prefix to prevent naming collisions, find your own logic and stick to it.

### Promises

AngularJs leverage promises

#### Route Resolve Promises
